Hello,

This assignment primarily focuses on the stock market tracking aspect for a user. 
The user can login in using their Google account and have up to four stock history reports shown to them as well as looking at the latest news for a selected company. 
In addition to that they are shown a banner at the top which has the current news going on in the stock world. 
Lastly, they can look at the market and judge their own opinions whether they should or should not trade. 

Thank you for going through our assignment,
Scott (s3600531) & Peter (s3602584)
